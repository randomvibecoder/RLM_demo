      "response": "Based on the provided context from kernel/sched/fair.c, **the calculation of sched_slice is not shown**.\n\nThe context only shows `se->slice` being **used** in the `update_entity_lag` function:\n\n**Line 18**: `limit = calc_delta_fair(max_t(u64, 2*se->slice, TICK_NSEC), se);`\n\nThis line uses `se->slice` (which appears to be the same as `sched_slice`), but the actual calculation/definition of this value is not present in the provided context. The context shows `se->slice` being multiplied by 2 and then passed to `calc_delta_fair()`, but does not include the function or code that initially computes `sched_slice`."
