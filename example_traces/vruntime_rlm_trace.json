  "final_answer": "vruntime in CFS is a 64-bit unsigned integer (`u64 vruntime`) in `struct sched_entity` that represents the virtual runtime of a task. It is the actual elapsed run time normalized by the task's weight. CFS schedules the task with the smallest vruntime next to achieve fair CPU scheduling proportional to task weights."
