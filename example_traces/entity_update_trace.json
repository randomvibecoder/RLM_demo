  "final_answer": "`entity_cfs_rq` is a structure in the Linux kernel's CFS scheduler that represents a sched_entity (task) within a CFS run queue. It updates vruntime by calling `update_vruntime()` with the cfs_rq's min_vruntime as a reference, ensuring the entity's vruntime (`se->vruntime`) is always at least equal to the run queue's minimum vruntime. This maintains the scheduling fairness invariant by preventing tasks from falling too far behind in virtual time."
