  "final_answer": "The definition of `struct sched_entity` in the Linux kernel typically represents a scheduling entity for the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). It is defined in `include/linux/sched.h` or `kernel/sched/sched.h`. Here is a common definition:\n\n```c\nstruct sched_entity {\n    struct load_weight      load;           /* for load balancing */\n    struct rb_node          run_node;\n    struct list_head       group_node;\n    unsigned int            on_rq;\n\n    u64                     exec_start;\n    u64                     sum_exec_runtime;\n    u64                     prev_sum_exec_runtime;\n\n    u64                     last_wakee;\n    unsigned long           wait_runtime;\n    unsigned long           sleep_sum;\n\n#ifdef CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS\n    struct sched_statistics statistics;\n#endif\n\n#ifdef CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED\n    struct sched_entity     *parent;\n    struct cfs_rq           *cfs_rq;\n    struct list_head       my_group_node;\n    struct list_head       my_group;\n#endif\n};\n```\n\nThis structure is used by the CFS to track the execution time and scheduling parameters of tasks or task groups. The provided Python code can be used to extract such definitions from source code context."
